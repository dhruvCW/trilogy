## Unreleased

## 2.6.0

### Changed

  - `TCP_NODELAY` is enabled on all TCP connections #122

## 2.4.0

### Added
  - Implement set_option functionality, and add #set_server_option method to the Ruby binding. #52
  - Implement multi-result support on the Ruby binding; TRILOGY_CAPABILITIES_MULTI_RESULTS flag enabled by default. #57
  - Add `TRILOGY_FLAGS_CAST_ALL_DECIMALS_TO_BIGDECIMALS` flag, which enforces casting to BigDecimal even for column types
    without decimal digits. #59
  - Implement #discard to close child connections without impacting parent. #65

### Fixed
  - Fix msec values for time columns. #61

### Changed
  - (BREAKING CHANGE) C API `#trilogy_build_auth_packet` accepts encoding option now. The Ruby binding for the
    Trilogy client can now accept an `:encoding` option, which will tell the connection to use the specified encoding,

    utf8mb4 is used by default. #64
